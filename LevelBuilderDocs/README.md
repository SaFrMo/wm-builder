## Saving Progress\
The level builder auto-saves your work to `localstorage` every five seconds.  More information on `localstorage` can be found at this [reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).  In short, progress is saved frequently and will be persistent across browser sessions, so it will still be there even if the browser tab or window is closed. \
