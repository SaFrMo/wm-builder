# Building Levels

The [level builder](https://white-mask.com/builder) is designed to make creating White Mask (WM) levels as easy as possible. Let's get started creating our own stages!

## Layout

When you load the builder, you'll see something like this:

The WM Builder is divided into three sections: **meta**, **map**, and **actions**.

Let's go through these one at a time.

## Meta

"Meta" in this case refers to extra information about the board - the board's name and any arbitrary information that should be attached to it.

Let's set this board's name. Click "Board" in the upper left hand corner and change the text to "Mona Lisa."

Now, let's add some arbitrary information to this board - for example, the fact that it was painted in the early 16th century.

Any arbitrary information needs a _key_ which it will be stored under, as well as a _value_ which contains the information itself. Click "Add More Info" and enter "Trivia" as the key and "Painted in the early 16th century" as the value.

This is a great start! We can add information that will be displayed to the player in this meta section, as well as information relevant only to the developer - whatever we want.

The board is autosaved every few seconds in your browser, too, so you don't need to worry about constantly keeping your data up to date. (We'll cover exporting data a little later, once we've got more to export.)

Let's jump over to the Map and keep going.
