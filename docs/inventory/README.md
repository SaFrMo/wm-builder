# Inventory

Every item in the player's inventory needs to have some representation in their [home base](/home-base/), giving the play the opportunity to view, interact, and improve it.

Every Inventory item has a few basic characteristics:

-   Name
-   GUID
-   Description
-   Icon
-   Model
-   Value
